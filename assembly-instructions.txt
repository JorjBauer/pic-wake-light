General Notes
-------------

This project is a PIC-based wake-light timer. It uses blue LEDs as a
wake light, and is designed to be integrated in to a sleeping mask (so
that you can wake up with a wake-light without waking up other people
in the same room). I had reasonable success with this mask on Amazon:

... while it looks really cheap, it *is*. And that's its benefit. It
was easy to slide two LEDs inside the foam without affecting the parts
that touch your face.



There are two mistakes on the v1.3 PCB:

1. No crystal. Oops. Solder it, and its capacitors, on the bottom side.

2. The drill holes are the wrong size for inductor's leads. Oops
again. The current running through the inductor is relatively low, so
I accepted the size and spent 20 minutes whittling down the leads on a
22uH inductor so they'd fit in the teeny holes. And then soldering the
inductor on both sides of the PCB (since one hole is a through-trace,
and I didn't think the solder would flow properly through the
now-overstuffed hole). You may need to be creative.

Parts list
----------

All parts came from mouser.com, updated November 2010. Digikey has
them too. This is < $20 in parts (probably < $15).

2    (*)       			10pF NP0 ceramic disc capacitors
2    (**)			470nm blue LEDs

(*) For some reason, I thought I wanted the v1.3 PCB to run
crystal-free from an internal oscillator (a bad idea for a timekeeping
device). I grabbed the watch crystal from a bag I bought from SparkFun
at some point, and two 10pF capacitors that I had lying around. (These
three parts are soldered on the bottom of the PCB, directly against
the PIC socket pins.) Mouser's 520-ECS-32-12.5-13X crystal is probably
a good choice. The capacitors should be NP0-type (aka C0G) to avoid
drifting too much with temperature. 140-50N5-100J-TB-RC is probably a
good pick.

(**) I didn't order the blue LEDs from Mouser (had them in my junk
bins), so I can't give a definitive part number. 470nm is
important. If it's not listed as 470nm, it won't wake you up as well
(check the datasheet). Brighter is generally better -- but don't get
carried away. 696-LX100133USBC might be a good choice (800mcd,
470nm). And conversely, 828-OVLFB3C7 might be a *bad* choice (the
manufacturer recommends that you not look directly in to the LEDs,
lest retina damage should occur). READ THE DATASHEET for whatever
you're about to buy.


Assembly
--------

This is a fairly easy build, aside from my mistakes on the PCB printing.

A word about orientation: hold the board so that the battery will be
at the bottom. In this orientation, the 7-segment LED will be
installed so that it is right-side-up (the decimal point is in the
lower-right), with the two switches on its right. The switches will be
installed so that they "grip" vertically (the tines bend inward toward
the top and bottom, not the left and right). The PIC's notch needs to
be toward the top. Pay attention to the '+' markings for C1 and
C2. The diode should have its stripe on the left. And the MAX756 will
be installed so that its Pin #1 (with the dot next to it) will be in
the upper-right.

Before installing any of that, I'd prepare the board so that it will
fit in your enclosure. You can round off the corners and fit it in an
Altoids gum tin.

I'd recommend starting with the surface-mount parts (the MAX756 in
particular) and then working through the socket; 7-segment LED;
switches; inductor; capacitors; resistors. The oscillator and its two
caps should be soldered at the end, along with the LEDs.

If you want one of the switches mounted on the outside of your
enclosure, you'll want to skip that switch until then end,
too. (Solder wires to one hole on the upper-left and one hole on the
upper-right side of where the switch would have been. The lower two
holes aren't connected to anything on the PCB. And the left button is
the mode button; that's probably the one you want outside your
enclosure.)

Finally, the LEDs should be jumped off of the two points just under
the switches. GND and + are labeled. (Okay, this qualifies as a third
error on the PCB; this jumper should *not* be in the middle of the
PCB. What was I thinking???)

After you connect the wires for your LEDs, just connect the LEDs in
parallel as you find fits your application.

The crystal needs to be soldered to pins 15 and 16 of the PIC, with
capacitors between each leg of the crystal and ground (conveniently,
pin 5 of the PIC). You can probably get away without the capacitors
with some loss of stability of the crystal. Once the crystal is in
place the way you want it, I'd recommend glueing it in place (either
cyanoacrylate or hot melt).
