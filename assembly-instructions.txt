General Notes
-------------

There are two mistakes on the v1.3 PCB:

1. No crystal. Oops. Solder it, and its capacitors, on the bottom side.

2. The drill holes are the wrong size for inductor's leads. Oops
again. The current running through the inductor is relatively low, so
I accepted the size and spent 20 minutes whittling down the leads on a
22uH inductor so they'd fit in the teeny holes. And then soldering the
inductor on both sides of the PCB (since one hole is a through-trace,
and I didn't think the solder would flow properly through the
now-overstuffed hole). You may need to be creative.

Parts list
----------

All parts came from mouser.com, updated November 2010. Digikey has
them too. This is < $20 in parts (probably < $15).

1    COM-00540 (*)		[from sparkfun.com] 32.768 kHz watch crystal
2    (*)       			10pF NP0 ceramic disc capacitors
2    (**)			470nm blue LEDs

(*) For some reason, I thought I wanted the v1.3 PCB to run
crystal-free from an internal oscillator (a bad idea for a timekeeping
device). I grabbed the watch crystal from a bag I bought from SparkFun
at some point, and two 10pF capacitors that I had lying around. (These
three parts are soldered on the bottom of the PCB, directly against
the PIC socket pins.) Mouser's 520-ECS-32-12.5-13X crystal is probably
a good choice. The capacitors should be NP0-type (aka C0G) to avoid
drifting too much with temperature. 140-50N5-100J-TB-RC is probably a
good pick.

(**) I didn't order the blue LEDs from Mouser (had them in my junk
bins), so I can't give a definitive part number. 470nm is
important. If it's not listed as 470nm, it won't wake you up as well
(check the datasheet). Brighter is generally better -- but don't get
carried away. 696-LX100133USBC might be a good choice (800mcd,
470nm). And conversely, 828-OVLFB3C7 might be a *bad* choice (the
manufacturer recommends that you not look directly in to the LEDs,
lest retina damage should occur). READ THE DATASHEET for whatever
you're about to buy.


Assembly
--------

This is a fairly easy build, aside from my mistakes on the PCB printing.

I'd recommend starting with the surface-mount parts (the MAX756 in
particular) and then working through the socket; 7-segment LED;
switches; inductor; capacitors; resistors. The oscillator and its two
caps should be soldered at the end, along with the LEDs.

If you want one of the switches mounted on the outside of your
enclosure, you'll want to skip that switch until then end, too.

The LEDs should be connected in parallel.
